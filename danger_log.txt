Danger log:
Database:
1. Duplicate balance creations of the same account cannot be accumulated, which means you can only create an accont and its balance for one time. If you try to do a large amount of order operations, you may have to set the balance at a high level amount to guarantee it is enough for all your operations. Otherwise the later processed operations will not be done due to the lack of balance.
2. We choose int data type for most fields, and there will be a limit for them. The numbers of those fields cannot be out of int range. 

Parser:
1. Parsing is done with pugixml parser, the outer tag is used to identify the request type (create/transaction). The inner tag determine account/position creation(create), or order/query/cancel request.
2. To ensure concurrency, each parsing function is locked with a lock_gaurd, that will unlock when exiting the function.
3. The xml is recieved in the format of string from socket. It is interpreted as xml document and then processed as described above; xml document is saved as stringstream and converted back to string to send back to the client.
